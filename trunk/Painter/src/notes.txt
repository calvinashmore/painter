
Some notes on how to manage Painter:

I have been looking at source code for the GIMP, and have been trying to figure
out exactly how the brush and painting mechanics should come together. My
thoughts are looking at a system like this....

class Stroke {
    class StrokePoint {
        LVect2d position;
        LDouble pressure;
        // etc?
    }

    List<StrokePoint> points;

    public LVect2d getPosition(double t);
    public double getPressure(double t);
    public double getAngle(double t);
}

class PointStroke extends Stroke {}

class Brush {
    public void draw(Stroke stroke);
    // also info for color, can take various parameters, things?
}

// brush can be extended to many specialized kinds of brushes
class SpecialBrush extends Brush;
